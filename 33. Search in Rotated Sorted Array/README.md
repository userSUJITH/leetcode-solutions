# 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

### Difficulty: Medium

## Description
There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly left rotated at an unknown index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be left rotated by 3 indices and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
Example 3:
Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1

 
Constraints:


	1 <= nums.length <= 5000
	-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
	All values of nums are unique.
	nums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
	-104 <= target <= 104
