# 3870. Count Commas in Range

### Difficulty: Easy

## Description
You are given an integer n.

Return the total number of commas used when writing all integers from [1, n] (inclusive) in standard number formatting.

In standard formatting:


	A comma is inserted after every three digits from the right.
	Numbers with fewer than 4 digits contain no commas.


 
Example 1:


Input: n = 1002

Output: 3

Explanation:

The numbers "1,000", "1,001", and "1,002" each contain one comma, giving a total of 3.


Example 2:


Input: n = 998

Output: 0

Explanation:

All numbers from 1 to 998 have fewer than four digits. Therefore, no commas are used.


 
Constraints:


	1 <= n <= 105
